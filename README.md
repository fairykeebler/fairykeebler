🐞 You can call me my in-game name or lena, idm! I'm not sure how to code but ill eventually figure it out so for the time being I'll write about myself here. 

📜 I go by she/her and prefer that but I dont mind if you use different pronouns. *Check all my links to get more info!*

🪩 Personality: Infj-t - This is a part of the mbti. "What does it mean?" Introverted, Intuitive, and deep thinkers who are turbulent advocates, and tend to be more laid back with a tight circle of friends.

🎭 I have a lot of interests, but my main interests right now are supernatural, grey's anatomy, buffy the vampire slayer, the long walk, breaking bad, my little pony, the boys, aqua teen hunger force, vintage physical media, music, fleetwood mac, weezer, medicine, rock, skincare, marvel, dc, art, 70's-90's, martial arts, dance, and plenty of others!

Boundaries

- If I'm playing pony town, feel free to interact! Interact in this sense means cuddle & hug, talk or whatever, just dont be weird towards me.

- I block freely

- Do not take it personally if I dont friend you, I rarely request or accept.

That's all for now because I cannot code to save my life :)
